# AI-Powered Resume Screening Tool

This project is an **AI-powered resume screening tool** that helps to match resumes with a given job description. It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques such as **TF-IDF** and **Cosine Similarity** to rank resumes based on how well they match the job description. The tool is built using **Streamlit** for the web interface, **PyMuPDF** for extracting text from PDFs, and **scikit-learn** for performing the NLP tasks.

## Features
- Upload multiple **resumes in PDF format**.
- Paste the **job description** for the position you want to screen for.
- The tool processes the resumes and ranks them based on their similarity to the job description using **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity**.
- View the ranked list of resumes with their **match scores**.
- Download the results as a **CSV** file for further analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: For creating the web interface and interacting with users.
- **PyMuPDF**: For extracting text from PDF files.
- **scikit-learn**: For implementing **TF-IDF vectorization** and calculating **Cosine Similarity**.
- **Pandas**: For handling data and displaying results in a table format.
